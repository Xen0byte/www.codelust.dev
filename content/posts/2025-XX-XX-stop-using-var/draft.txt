-- it's a calamitous atrocity --

If `clients` is an **enumeration (`IEnumerable<T>`)** rather than a **concrete collection (`List<T>`, `T[]`, etc.)**, then every time you iterate over `clients` (e.g. in a `foreach`, `.ToList()`, `.Count()`, etc.), the underlying sequence will be re-evaluated.

### What this means in practice:

* **If `GetClients()` returns a query** (like an EF Core LINQ query, or something built on `yield return`):

  * Each enumeration re-runs the logic, potentially hitting the database or recomputing values.
  * Side effects (logging, network calls, DB queries) happen every time you iterate.
  * Performance can degrade unexpectedly.
* **If it returns a materialized collection** (`List<T>`, `Array`, `HashSet<T>`, etc.):

  * No problem. Multiple iterations are just reusing the already-fetched in-memory data.

### Example

```csharp
var clients = context.Clients.Where(c => c.IsActive); // IQueryable/IEnumerable
foreach (var c in clients) { ... } // Executes query
foreach (var c in clients) { ... } // Executes query again!
```

vs.

```csharp
var clients = await context.Clients.Where(c => c.IsActive).ToListAsync(); 
foreach (var c in clients) { ... } // Uses same in-memory list
foreach (var c in clients) { ... } // Still in-memory, no extra DB call
```

### Rule of thumb

If you’re not 100% sure whether the source is materialized, **force it with `.ToList()` or `.ToArray()`** when you assign:

```csharp
var clients = (await GetClients()).ToList();
```

👉 This guarantees that `clients` is a concrete collection, safe to reuse without surprises.

### 2. **Unintended numeric type**

```csharp
var total = 1 / 2; 
```

* Type: `int` (since both operands are `int`).
* Problem: `total` becomes `0`, not `0.5`. If you thought it was `double`, you’ll silently get wrong results.
* Fix:

  ```csharp
  double total = 1 / 2.0; // 0.5
  ```

---

So in short:

* With queries, `var` can hide that you’re holding a deferred-execution enumerable instead of actual data.
* With arithmetic, `var` can lock you into an unintended (smaller or lossy) type.

Perfect 👍 — here’s a **Top 10 `var` Pitfalls in C# Cheat Sheet**, each with a quick code sample and what can go wrong.

---

## 🔟 Common Pitfalls with `var`

### 1. **Deferred Execution (`IEnumerable` vs concrete collection)**

```csharp
var clients = db.Clients.Where(c => c.IsActive); // IQueryable<Client>
foreach (var c in clients) { } // DB query executes
foreach (var c in clients) { } // Executes again!
```

💥 Multiple queries when you thought it was cached.
✅ Fix: `var clients = db.Clients.Where(...).ToList();`

---

### 2. **Anonymous Types Can’t Escape Scope**

```csharp
var client = new { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 }; 
```

💥 Can’t return this type from a method or store in a collection.
✅ Use a real `Client` class.

---

### 3. **Async Return Confusion (`Task<T>` vs `T`)**

```csharp
var text = File.ReadAllTextAsync("file.txt"); // Task<string>
Console.WriteLine(text.Length); // ❌ Not what you think
```

💥 Accidentally working with the `Task`, not the result.
✅ `var text = await File.ReadAllTextAsync("file.txt");`

---

### 4. **Numeric Overflow / Wrong Type**

```csharp
var big = 100000 * 100000; // int
Console.WriteLine(big); // ❌ Overflow
```

💥 Silent overflow since it’s `int`.
✅ `long big = 100000L * 100000;`

---

### 5. **Integer Division Surprise**

```csharp
var ratio = 1 / 2; // int
Console.WriteLine(ratio); // 0
```

💥 If you expected a `double`, you’re wrong.
✅ `double ratio = 1 / 2.0;`

---

### 6. **Boxing and Performance Issues**

```csharp
var number = GetObject(); // object
int value = (int)number;  // boxing/unboxing
```

💥 If you thought it was already `int`, perf and runtime errors appear.
✅ Declare the concrete type.

---

### 7. **Nullable Value Types Hidden**

```csharp
var age = dbRow["Age"]; // object (nullable DB field)
int x = (int)age;       // ❌ NullReferenceException
```

💥 You think it’s `int`, but it’s really `int?` or `object`.
✅ Explicitly handle nullable types.

---

### 8. **Implicitly Wrong Collection Type**

```csharp
var clients = new[] { "Alice", "Bob" }; // string[]
```

💥 If you expected `List<string>`, you lose `List` methods.
✅ Be explicit: `List<string> clients = new() { "Alice", "Bob" };`

---

### 9. **Dynamic APIs Returning `object`**

```csharp
var json = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<object>("{}");
```

💥 You think `json` is a dictionary, but it’s just `object`. Casting headaches follow.
✅ Explicitly specify generic type: `Deserialize<Dictionary<string, object>>()`.

---

### 10. **Reduced Readability for Teams**

```csharp
var x = MethodThatReturnsSomething();
```

💥 Nobody knows what `x` is without hovering or jumping to definition. Maintenance pain.
✅ Only use `var` when the type is obvious from the right-hand side.

---

## ✅ Rule of Thumb

* Use `var` when the type is **clear and obvious** (e.g. `var client = new Client();`).
* Avoid it when the type is **ambiguous, surprising, or critical to correctness** (async, queries, arithmetic).
