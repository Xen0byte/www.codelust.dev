Hi, my name is Lex! I am a quality-focused .NET solutions architect, and I spend an unhealthy amount of time shaving yaks and researching code obscurities.

Some of my hobbies are deciphering arcane solutions, resolving nebulous problem statements, and dark mode.

CodeLust is where I dump my brain - tools, technologies, trends, opinions, rants, what the best metal music is for debugging, and the occasional "why the hell doesn't this work" post turned tutorial.

If you're into lean code, over-caffeinated sarcasm, and figuring things out the hard way, you're in the right place.

Let's break things. Then fix them better.
