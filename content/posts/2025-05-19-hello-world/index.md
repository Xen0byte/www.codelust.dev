Hi, my name is Lex! I am a quality-focused .NET solutions architect, and I spend an unhealthy amount of time shaving yaks and researching code obscurities.

Some of my hobbies are deciphering arcane solutions, resolving nebulous problem statements, and dark mode.

For my 6<sup>th</sup> birthday, my mum gifted me a 10-year-old ZX Spectrum because she wanted to upgrade my Super Design Ending-Man BS-500 AS, a famiclone affectionately known as the Terminator 2. To her surprise, instead of playing the games, I would spend all day programming in Sinclair BASIC which the ZX Spectrum booted into. That was my introduction to programming, and I will never forget the stack of paper sheets that I would end up copying my code to until discovering much later on that I could save programs to cassette tapes, after finding an official ZX Spectrum manual at my local flea market.

In school, I started learning Borland Pascal by writing programs directly onto paper because we didnâ€™t have any computers, and once my school acquired its first computer, an Intel 80486 which was meant to be used for keeping school library inventory, I started staying after school trying out all my programs in Turbo Pascal and then finishing the days off with some Command & Conquer: Red Alert.

I would then, for a while, experiment with Java, Python, JavaScript, and F#, before finally settling on C# as my programming language of choice, under the mentorship of Paul Louth, the creator of [language-ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext), a framework for infusing C# with monadic functions, which we all know are just morphisms in the category of Kleisli composition.

CodeLust is where I dump my brain - tools, technologies, trends, opinions, rants, what the best metal music is for debugging, and the occasional "why the hell does this not work" post turned tutorial.

If you're into lean code, over-caffeinated sarcasm, and figuring things out the hard way, you're in the right place.

Let's break things apart with purpose, understand then with perspective, then assemble them better with precision.
